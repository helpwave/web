# Storybook
The components of our [library](../lib) can be looked at in the storybook, where the different
parameters of the component can be set individually.

This allows you to see which components already exist and how to use them. 
The current version can be seen here https://storybook-lib.helpwave.de.

```shell
cd lib
pnpm run storybook
```
