This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

## Environment variables

> See `utils/config.ts` for more.

Create a file called `env.local` from the already existing `.env` file.

At build time and at runtime the correctness of the environment variables is validated, make sure that they are present at each step (even in github actions or similar).

If something is incorrect or missing an error will be thrown.

### gRPC-web

To communicate with [`helpwave-services`](https://github.com/helpwave/services) (our gRPC APIs) this projects uses gRPC-web.

#### Code generation

[Follow the installation steps on github.com/grpc/grpc-web.](https://github.com/grpc/grpc-web#code-generator-plugin)

```bash
# Generate gRPC-web code for the ward-svc rpc service
protoc --proto_path=../../helpwave-services/proto/services/task_svc/v1 ward_svc.proto --js_out=import_style=commonjs:generated --grpc-web_out=import_style=typescript,mode=grpcwebtext:generated
```
